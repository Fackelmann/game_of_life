# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's game of life implemented in C++.

To run it:

```
make run
```

This will load an [acorn](https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Acorn) pattern and print the iterations out to the terminal.

You can load any initial state you want by providing a text file where the first line provides the number columns, the second line the number of lines, and the rest of the file the initial pattern, where `.` is dead, and `#` is alive.

To run the unit tests:

```
make test
```
